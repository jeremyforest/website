Broadly speaking I am interested in the biological and computational mechanisms underlying learning and memory.   

I am currently doing a postdoc in the lab of [Thomas Cleland](http://cplab.net/people/thomas-cleland/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) oriented towards a computational neuroscience approach. We are working on the development of better olfactory processing models and the implementation of this model in neuromorphic architectured (namely [Loihi2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-unveils-neuromorphic-loihi-2-lava-software.html#gs.98k9hr)). 

Previously, I spent 1.5 years as a postdoctoral associate in [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), in the lab of [Alexander Reyes](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/alexander-reyes.html). I was working on is a collaboration between Alex's lab and the lab of [Stefano Fusi](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/people/stefano-fusi) at [Columbia University's Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/). The project was centered around learning and memory mechanisms, involving both an in-vitro and a modeling approach working synergically. The in vitro approach used cortical neuron cultures and whole-optic electrophysiology to probe memory storage abilities based on the modeling approach that elaborated a memory storage model of long-term memory. Working back and forth between those two approches we aimed at validating the computational model by contributing essential missing variable from in-vitro networks and at the same time improve the model's abilities to represent mechanisms of biological learning and memory storage. Unfortunately, this project was cut short. 

Before that, I obtained my Phd in Neuroscience in France from [Lyon 1 University](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/) in December 2017. My project was supervised by [Nathalie Mandairon](https://sites.google.com/view/nathalie-mandairon/accueil) and [Anne Didier](https://www.crnl.fr/en/user/105) from the [Neuropop team](https://www.crnl.fr/en/equipe/neuropop) of the [Lyon Neuroscience Research Center](https://www.crnl.fr/en). My thesis work was to better understand the learning and memory mechanisms involved in olfactory perceptual learning in the olfactory bulb in mice. My focus was on how the olfactory bulb circuitry -involving both preexisting and adult-born neurons- is modified after complex environmental modifications (involving the discrimination learning of several pairs of perceptualy close odorants at the same time) or changing environmental modifications (involving the discrimination learning of different pairs of odorants over time). I studied this using mice behavioral analysis, immunochemistry staining, neuron morphologogy analysis, optogenetics and modeling (integrate and fire neurons).
